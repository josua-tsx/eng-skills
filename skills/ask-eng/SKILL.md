# Ask eng-skills

You don't remember every skill, so ask.

A **flow** is a path through the skills. Most paths run along one **main flow**, and two **on-ramps** merge onto it. Everything else is standalone, or a vocabulary layer that runs underneath.

## The main flow: idea → ship

The route most work travels. You have an idea and want it built.

1. **`/grill-with-docs`** sharpens the idea by interview. Start here whenever you are **working in a working directory**: it's stateful, retaining what it learns in `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs. (No working directory? Use `/grill-me` instead, covered under Standalone. Both run the same `/grilling` primitive; `grill-with-docs` is the one that leaves a paper trail, which makes it the better of the two whenever a repo is there to leave it in.)
2. **Branch: can you settle every question in conversation?** If a question needs a runnable answer (state, business logic, a UI you have to see), detour through a prototype. This pack does not include `/handoff`; open a fresh session against the prototype directory, then bring what you learned back into the original idea thread:
   - **`/prototype`** to answer the question with throwaway code,
   - reference the result from the original idea thread.
3. **Branch: is this a multi-session build?**
   - **Yes** → **`/to-spec`** (turn the thread into a spec), then **`/to-tickets`** to split it into tracer-bullet tickets, each declaring its **blocking edges**. Then work the tickets one of two ways:
     - **`/implement`** per ticket, clearing context between each one. On a local tracker that's one file per ticket under `.scratch/<feature>/issues/`, worked blockers-first by hand; on a real tracker the edges become native blocking links, so any ticket whose blockers are done can be grabbed. Each ticket is self-contained, so the last one's context is disposable.
     - **`/implement-spec`** for the whole spec in one run. It reads the tickets as a **task graph**, runs implementer subagents across the ready **frontier** in parallel, and lands everything on one **integration branch**. Reach for it when you'd rather orchestrate the build than drive each ticket yourself.
   - **No** → **`/implement`** right here, in the same context window.

   Either way, the code gets built by driving **`/tdd`** (one red-green slice at a time) and closes out with **`/code-review`**, a two-axis review (Standards + Spec) of the diff. `/implement` runs both per ticket; `/implement-spec`'s implementers each drive `/tdd`, and it runs one `/code-review` over the integration branch. Reach for **`/tdd`** on its own when you just want to build a concrete behaviour test-first without a full spec, and **`/code-review`** on its own whenever you want to review a branch or PR against a fixed point.

   When the work goes up as a pull request, **`/pr`** shapes the body: the smallest visual that shows the change, before/after evidence that it works, and a one-way or two-way door call. It's model-invoked, so the agent reaches for it whenever it writes a PR.

4. **`/retro`** closes the loop. After a build, and especially one that went sideways, it looks back over the session and suggests changes to the agent's **environment**, not the code: navigation pointers, automated checks, the coding standards `/code-review` enforces, steering files, tooling. Mechanical mistakes become deterministic checks; judgement calls become coding standards. The next build then starts from a better environment.

### Context hygiene

Keep steps 1–3 in **one unbroken context window** (don't compact or clear until after `/to-tickets`) so the grilling, spec, and tickets all build on the same thinking. Each `/implement` then starts fresh, working from the ticket. Run `/retro` in the session it's looking back on, before you clear; after clearing, point it at that session's log instead.

The limit on this is the **[smart zone](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/smart-zone)**: the window (~150k tokens on state-of-the-art models) within which the model still reasons sharply. If a session approaches it before `/to-tickets`, don't push on degraded; `/compact` at the nearest phase boundary and carry on (see Phase boundaries).

## On-ramps

A starting situation that generates work, then merges onto the main flow.

- **Something's broken** → **`/diagnosing-bugs`**. For the hard ones: the bug that resists a first glance, the intermittent flake, the regression that crept in between two known-good states. It refuses to theorise until it has a **tight feedback loop** (one command that already goes red on *this* bug), then fixes with a regression test.

- **A huge, foggy effort: a greenfield project or a huge feature build, too big for one session** → **`/wayfinder`**, the most cognitively demanding flow here. When the way from here to the destination isn't visible yet, it charts a **shared map** of **decision tickets** on the issue tracker and resolves them one at a time, producing **decisions, not deliverables**, until the fog is pushed back and the way is clear. Where **`/grill-with-docs`** sharpens an idea you can hold in one session, wayfinder is for the idea you can't, and it's slower and denser, so save it for exactly that, never a well-scoped feature.

  When the map clears, **it hands off, it doesn't build**: merge onto the main flow at **`/to-spec`**, which collapses the map's linked decisions into a buildable plan, then `/to-tickets` and `/implement` as usual. Looping the map straight into `/implement` skips that collapse and throws the linked detail away, so go straight to `/implement` only when the effort turned out genuinely small.

## Vocabulary underneath

Two model-invoked references that run *beneath* the other skills, each the single source of truth for its vocabulary. Reach for them directly when the **words**, not the process, are the problem; or let the skills above pull them in.

- **`/domain-modeling`**: sharpen the project's *domain* language: challenge a fuzzy term, resolve an overloaded word ("account" doing three jobs), record a hard-to-reverse decision as an ADR. It's the active discipline `/grill-with-docs` drives to keep `GLOSSARY.md` a clean glossary.
- **`/codebase-design`** is the deep-module vocabulary (module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage, locality) for designing a module's *shape*: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface at a clean seam. `/tdd` speaks it.

## Phase boundaries

A **phase** is a chunk of work inside a session: the grilling, the implementation, the QA. At the **boundary** between two of them you have five options, and picking between them is the fuzziest decision in this whole map:

- **Continue**: stay put. Costs nothing, loses nothing.
- **`/clear`**: empty the window, when nothing here matters to what's next.
- Portable markdown / a new directory: this pack does not include `/handoff`; write a short note or open a fresh session.
- **Subagent**: send a tightly-scoped task to its own window and get a report back.
- **`/compact`** compresses this context and seeds a fresh session with it. The **default**, at the bottom of the tree rather than the first reach.

Read [PHASE-BOUNDARIES.md](PHASE-BOUNDARIES.md) for the ordered tree: the five questions, the reasoning behind each branch, and why the primary-source cost makes **Continue** the one to rule out first. Make the decision **at** a boundary; mid-phase, continue or split the rest into subagents.

## Standalone

Off the main flow entirely.

- **`/grill-me`**: the same relentless interview as `/grill-with-docs`, but **stateless**: it saves nothing locally and builds no `GLOSSARY.md`. Reach for it when you are **not working in a working directory** (sharpening a plan, a design, a piece of writing, anything with no repo under it). If you are in a working directory, use `/grill-with-docs` instead: it runs the same interview and leaves a paper trail, so it is strictly the better one.
- **`/grilling`** is the interview primitive itself: rounds, the frontier, facts are the agent's job and decisions are yours. `/grill-me` and `/grill-with-docs` are the two named ways in. Reach for it directly only when you want the interview with no wrapper around it.
- **`/prototype`** is a small, throwaway program that answers one design question: does this state model feel right, or what should this UI look like. Throwaway is a constraint on how the code is written, not a promise to destroy it: the answer folds into the real code, and the prototype itself is kept as a **primary source** on a `prototype/<name>` branch out of main, pointed at from the implementation issue. It's the detour in step 2 of the main flow, but reach for it any time a design question is hard to settle on paper.
- **`/research`**: delegate reading legwork to a **background agent**: it investigates a question against **primary sources**, then leaves a cited Markdown file in the repo. Keep working while it reads. The file it produces is something to take *into* the main flow at `/grill-with-docs`, since research feeds the thinking rather than replacing it.
- **`/writing-for-agents`** is the reference for writing documents agents consume: skills, AGENTS.md, pointed-at docs.
- **`/learn-go`** — coach **Go engineering literacy** from a standalone vault and the existing CRM lab. User-invoked. Not a syntax course; not a reason to pull this in when product work merely mentions Go.
- **`/learn-devops`** — coach a **junior DevOps** learning session from a fixed vault roadmap and one small lab app. User-invoked. Not for dockerizing a production or multi-service product; not a reason to pull this in when the work merely mentions Docker or CI.
- **`/learn-system-design`** — coach **production system-design judgment** from a standalone mastery-gated vault. User-invoked. Not a component catalog, a CRM course, or a reason to pull this in when ordinary work mentions architecture or scale.

## Precondition

**`/setup-eng-skills`**: run before your first engineering flow to configure the issue tracker, triage labels, and doc layout the other skills assume. Custom issue trackers also work.

## House adaptations

- Skill renamed from `ask-matt` → `ask-eng`; routes over **this** pack only.
- Pack does **not** include: `handoff`, `triage`, `improve-codebase-architecture`, `resolving-merge-conflicts`. If a path above names them, skip that branch or use a normal chat handoff instead.
- After `/to-spec`, file-level how may use **Cursor Plan** mode; Plan is not a second Spec.
- Foggy mega-work: `/wayfinder` → when clear → `/to-spec` (not straight to `/implement` unless tiny).
- Dual-read: `GLOSSARY.md`, or `CONTEXT.md` if that is what the repo still has.
- Part of [josua-tsx/eng-skills](https://github.com/josua-tsx/eng-skills).
